  name: "Weather Dashboard",
  category: "Web App",
  image: "https://i.ibb.co/weather-dashboard.jpg",
  shortDescription: "Real-time weather app with beautiful UI",

    "7-day weather forecast",
    "Interactive weather maps",
    "Location-based alerts",
    "Beautiful data visualizations"
  ],
  liveLink: "https://weather-dashboard.vercel.app",
  githubClient: "https://github.com/yourusername/weather-dashboard",
  // No githubServer field - that's okay!
  challenges: "Handling API rate limits and creating smooth animations for weather transitions.",

## üì± After Adding Your Project

1. **Save the file** (`Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`)
2. **Check the browser** - it should auto-reload
3. **Test the card** - click to open the modal
4. **Verify all links** - Live Demo, GitHub buttons work
5. **Test filtering** - switch between categories

## üéØ Pro Tips

### Want to Reorder Projects?
Just change the order in the array! The first project appears first.

### Want to Hide a Project Temporarily?
Add two slashes `//` before the entire project object:
```javascript
// {
//   id: 3,
//   name: "Hidden Project",
//   ...
// },
```

### Want Different Categories?
Add your own category name - the filter will automatically include it!

### Want to Add More Fields?
You can add custom fields to the project object, but you'll need to update the `Projects.jsx` component to display them.
