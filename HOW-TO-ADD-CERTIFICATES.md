## 🐛 Common Mistakes to Avoid

{
  id: 5, // ⚠️ Same ID as another!
  title: My Certificate // ⚠️ Missing quotes!
  type: "certificate" // ⚠️ Wrong case! Use "Certificate"
  image: "" // ⚠️ Empty image!
  skills: "React" // ⚠️ Should be array: ["React"]
} // ⚠️ Missing comma!
```

### ✅ Do:
```javascript
{
  id: 6, // ✅ Unique ID
  title: "My Certificate", // ✅ Quoted
  type: "Certificate", // ✅ Correct case
  image: "https://i.ibb.co/image.jpg", // ✅ Valid URL
  skills: ["React", "Node.js"], // ✅ Array
}, // ✅ Comma at end
```

Choose a format and stick to it:

- "2024-01" ❌ (not consistent with text format)

### 3. Add Context in Description
Explain what the certificate represents and what you learned.

### 4. Link Everything
If you have a verification URL, always include it!

### 5. Update Regularly
Add new certificates as you earn them.
